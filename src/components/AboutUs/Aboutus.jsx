            The Tattva Project is a pioneering initiative with a mission to empower students by creating a programming education system that transcends language barriers. We focus on building a user-friendly environment based on Python, specifically designed for learners who speak and write in Kannada. Our aim is to democratize coding education, ensuring that language is not a barrier to acquiring essential programming skills.

      At the heart of the Tattva Project is an innovative system that allows students to write and execute Python code in Kannada, using English alphabets for transliteration. This approach makes programming more accessible, inviting a broader range of students to explore the world of coding without the additional challenge of mastering English.
